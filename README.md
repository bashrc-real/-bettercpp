# -bettercpp
<title>An attempt to learn c++ while filling the gaps that I feel make the learning curve for writing 
good efficient c++ harder </title>
The motivation for this project came from interacting and reviewing c++ code from peers and in open source.
c++11 brought with itself a pleothera of features which give the language a touch of modern programming language.</br>
While most modern programming languages were designed initially with the intention of removing ambiguity for programmers </br>
and abstracting things to the level where one can just translate logic into code without worrying about more finer details </br>
c++ was developed to give the performance of C with some structure to enable scalable code. </br>
It's possible to write good c++ code without worrying about inner details. As a student of the language I am trying to see if I this </br>
gap can be bridged :)
