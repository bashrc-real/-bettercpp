# An attempt to learn c++ while filling the gaps that I feel make the learning curve for writing  good efficient c++ steeper
The motivation for this project came from interacting and reviewing c++ code from peers and in open source.
c++11 brought with itself a pleothera of features which give the language a touch of modern programming language.
While most modern programming languages were designed initially with the intention of removing ambiguity for programmers 
and abstracting things to the level where one can just translate logic into code without worrying about more finer details 
c++ was developed to give the performance of C with some structure to enable scalable code. 
It's possible to write good c++ code without worrying about inner details. As a student of the language I am trying to see if I this 
gap can be bridged :)
